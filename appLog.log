SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, techCategory=SQLDatabases, user=User [id=64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3, firstName=Ashutosh, lastName=Tigga, gender=Male, email=ashu@nucleusteq.com, password=MTIzNDU2, designation=Intern, contactNumber=7546464646, role=Employee, posts=null], status=Approved, comments=[], likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[]], FilterDashboardOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address. The following are key elements of the SQL database table:</p><ul style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0;

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.

SQL is used to execute basic data management functions and complex queries to transform available raw data into useful and contextual information. Database users can use standard SQL languages such as data definition language (DDL) for creating the database and table structures and data manipulation language (DML) to insert, update, delete, and select data within the tables.</p></div></div></div>, technology=SQLDatabases, createdAt=Fri Sep 15 01:39:34 IST 2023, editedAt=Thu Sep 21 00:05:31 IST 2023, likedBy=[64f9633fb7c60a26a47444e3], disLikedBy=[], comments=[]], FilterMyBlogPostOutDto [id=650368638f7b5f08243bf514, title=SQL database table structure, status=Approved, content=<p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px solid rgb(229, 231, 235); --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-pan-x: ; --tw-pan-y: ; --tw-pinch-zoom: ; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ordinal: ; --tw-slashed-zero: ; --tw-numeric-figure: ; --tw-numeric-spacing: ; --tw-numeric-fraction: ; --tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-blur: ; --tw-brightness: ; --tw-contrast: ; --tw-grayscale: ; --tw-hue-rotate: ; --tw-invert: ; --tw-saturate: ; --tw-sepia: ; --tw-drop-shadow: ; --tw-backdrop-blur: ; --tw-backdrop-brightness: ; --tw-backdrop-contrast: ; --tw-backdrop-grayscale: ; --tw-backdrop-hue-rotate: ; --tw-backdrop-invert: ; --tw-backdrop-opacity: ; --tw-backdrop-saturate: ; --tw-backdrop-sepia: ; margin: 0px 0px 0.75rem; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Roboto, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">SQL database server stores and organizes data in tables. In RDBMS, tables are fundamental database objects logically designed to collect data in rows and columns format. While rows reflect entities, columns define the attributes of each entity. For instance, in a customer data table, each row reflects a record for a specific customer, and each table column contains corresponding customer information, like the customer’s name and address.
